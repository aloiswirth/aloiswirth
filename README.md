- 👋 Hi, I’m @aloiswirth
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence and methods to deploy it in scale
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things. programming (yes I am a bloody amateur in programming, despite having spent some time on the subject / python), machine learning techniques,
deployment methodologies like kubernetes, and currently as well a bit of kubeflow to create pipelines automating what I am doing manually currently. :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn as much as possible and get to known better ways of approaching problems. Recently I found nbdev for jupyter notebooks, which helps me to organize my thoughts and document what I did.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
